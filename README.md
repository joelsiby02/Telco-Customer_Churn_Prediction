# Telco-Customer_Churn_Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project that analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using Python and Keras. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model building and evaluation, as well as a Jupyter notebook and a README file explaining the project in detail.


Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Introduction
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains customer data such as demographics, services subscribed, and account information. The target variable is whether the customer has churned or not.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which is available on Kaggle here is the link 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn'. It contains 7043 rows and 21 columns, with each row representing a customer and each column representing a feature. The target variable is the Churn column.

Data preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps performed on the dataset include handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, scaling numerical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Machine learning model
The machine learning model used in this project is a binary classification model using a neural network. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. [Done for Study Purpose]

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 0.79 on the testing set. The precision and recall for class 0 are 0.64 and 0.55, respectively, while the precision and recall for class 1 are 0.84 and 0.88, respectively. The F1 score for the model is 0.73.

Conclusion
The machine learning model developed in this project can be used to predict customer churn for the telecommunications company. The model achieved a decent accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, which can be further improved by fine-tuning the model or trying different machine learning algorithms.
